Vimbrant began as dark and vibrant colourscheme for the vim text
editor, and is based on the molokai vim colorscheme.

At some point I incorporated the general colourscheme into my
Xdefaults and then went about creating compatible themes for 
my daily console applications, including:

    * mutt (email)
    * moc (music on console)
    * ncmpc (mpd client)
    * vifm (file manager)
    * midnight commander (file manager)

Vim color file
Scriptname:   vimbrant
Author:       Thayer Williams <thayer.cinderwick.ca>
Description:  A vibrant light-on-dark colorscheme with support
for GUI, 256-color and 16-color terminals and optional transparency

Based on the molokai theme by Tomas Restrepo, which in turn 
is based on the monokai theme for textmate by Wimer Hazenberg
and its darker variant by Hamish Stuart Macpherson.  A big 
thanks to these individuals for making what are some of the 
best color schemes ever.

For optimal 16-color experience, add the following to ~/.bashrc:

# linux console colors -------------------------------------
if [ "$TERM" = "linux" ]; then
     echo -en "\e]P0000000" #black
     echo -en "\e]P8505354" #darkgrey
     echo -en "\e]P1f92672" #darkred
